            Faithfulness refers to how accurately the LLM captures the content and intent of the original Image.
            Each level will be accompanied by an explanation and an example to illustrate the degree of faithfulness.

            Scale:
                • 5 (Highly Faithful): The response directly reflects the content and intent of the image without introducing factual errors, misleading interpretations, or irrelevant information.
                • 4 (Mostly Faithful): The response captures the main points of the image but may contain minor factual inconsistencies, slight misinterpretations, or occasional irrelevant details.
                • 3 (Somewhat Faithful): The response partially reflects the image content but may contain significant factual errors, misinterpretations, or irrelevant information that alters the overall message.
                • 2 (Partially Unfaithful): The response substantially deviates from the image content, focusing on irrelevant information or presenting a misleading interpretation of the main points.
                • 1 (Not Faithful): The response bears no relation to the image content and presents entirely fabricated information.

            Evaluation Criteria:
            Here are some key factors to consider when evaluating the faithfulness of an LLM response to an image:
                • Factual Accuracy: Does the response accurately represent the factual information presented in the image?
                • Intent and Interpretation: Does the response capture the intended meaning and central message of the image?
                • Content Coverage: Does the response address the main points and arguments presented in the image, or does it focus on irrelevant details?
                • Neutrality: Does the response present a neutral and objective perspective on the information in the image, or does it introduce biases or opinions?
                • Coherence: Does the response maintain a logical flow of information consistent with the image structure and organization?

            Prompt given to the model:
            {{prompt}}

            Response to be evaluated:
            {{response}}

            Provide a score between 1 and 5. Also provide a short reasoning for the score.
            The response should only contain the reasoning and the score in number seperated by a comma. Do not include "\n" in the answer. STRICTLY Format your response as follows: reasoning,score 
            For example: "This is the reason, 1"
            DO NOT deviate from the format."""

                • 4 (Relevant): The response addresses the user's query but may not fully utilize the provided image. It offers valuable information but might lack depth or miss specific details relevant to the image's context.
                • 3 (Somewhat Relevant): The response partially addresses the user's query and shows some connection to the image's content. However, it may contain irrelevant information or fail to fully utilize the image's insights to answer the question effectively.
                • 2 (Partially Irrelevant): The response deviates significantly from the user's query and focuses on information not directly related to the image. It may contain some relevant details by coincidence, but it doesn't leverage the image's content to address the user's needs.
                • 1 (Not Relevant): The response bears no relation to the user's query or the provided image.

            Evaluation Criteria:
            Here are some key factors to consider when evaluating the relevance of an LLM response:
                • Addresses the Query: Does the response directly answer the question posed by the user, considering the context of the image?
                • Document Integration: Does the response demonstrate a clear understanding of the image's content and utilize it to support the answer?
                • Comprehensiveness: Does the response provide a complete and informative answer, considering both the user's query and the image's relevant information?
                • Focus: Does the response avoid irrelevant information or tangents, staying focused on the user's query and the image's key points?

            Prompt given to the model:
            {{prompt}}

            Response to be evaluated:
            {{response}}

            Provide a score between 1 and 5. Also provide a short reasoning for the score.
            The response should only contain the reasoning and the score in number seperated by a comma. Do not include "\n" in the answer. STRICTLY Format your response as follows: reasoning,score 
            For example: "This is the reason, 1"
            DO NOT deviate from the format."""

            adh_prompt= """**Evaluate Response Adherence to Original Prompt**

            You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing the quality of responses generated by language models. Your goal is to determine how well the response aligns with the original prompt and source image.

            **Evaluation Criteria:**

            **Adherence to the Original Prompt**: To what extent does the response follow the instructions, requirements, and context provided in the original prompt?

            **Scoring Guidelines:**

            Score of 1 (Off-Topic): The response is completely unrelated to the prompt, lacks relevance, or fails to address the main question/task.
            Example: Original Prompt: What are the benefits of meditation? Response to Evaluate: The capital of France is Paris. Score: 1 (The response is completely unrelated to the prompt and topic.)
            Score of 2 (Partial Adherence): The response touches on some aspects of the prompt but misses significant key points, context, or requirements.
            Example: Original Prompt: Describe the main features of a Tesla electric car. Response to Evaluate: Tesla cars are electric and have a large touchscreen. Score: 2 (The response mentions some features, but misses others, such as Autopilot, range, and design.)
            Score of 3 (Reasonable Adherence): The response addresses the prompt fairly well, but may omit some important details, nuances, or context.
            Example: Original Prompt: Summarize the plot of Romeo and Juliet. Response to Evaluate: Romeo and Juliet are from feuding families, fall in love, and die in the end. Score: 3 (The response covers the main plot points, but omits details, such as the balcony scene, the masquerade ball, and the role of Friar Lawrence.)
            Score of 4 (Mostly Adherent): The response closely follows the prompt, with only minor deviations, omissions, or inaccuracies.
            Example: Original Prompt: Explain the concept of artificial intelligence. Response to Evaluate: Artificial intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Score: 4 (The response accurately defines AI, but might miss some nuances, such as the difference between narrow and general AI.)
            Score of 5 (Full Adherence): The response fully addresses the prompt, covering all relevant information, context, and requirements.
            Example: Original Prompt: Describe the process of photosynthesis. Response to Evaluate: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of organic compounds, such as glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. Score: 5 (The response fully and accurately describes the process of photosynthesis, covering all relevant details.)

            corr_prompt="""**Evaluate Response Correctness**

            You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing the factual accuracy and correctness of responses generated by language models with respect to the provided source image. Your goal is to determine whether the response aligns with the information presented in the source image.

            **Evaluation Criteria:**

            **Correctness with Respect to Source**: Does the response accurately reflect the information, facts, and concepts presented in the source image?

            **Scoring Guidelines:**

            Score of 1 (Inconsistent with image)**: The response contradicts or is inconsistent with the information presented in the source image.
            Score of 2 (Partially Supported by image)**: The response is partially supported by the source image, but lacks key details, context, or nuance.
            Score of 3 (Generally Consistent with image)**: The response is generally consistent with the information presented in the source image, but may contain minor inaccuracies or oversimplifications.
            Score of 4 (Highly Consistent with image)**: The response is highly consistent with the information presented in the source image, with only minor nuances or technicalities missing.
            Score of 5 (Fully Consistent with image)**: The response is entirely consistent with the information presented in the source image, accurately reflecting all relevant details, context, and nuance.

            Overall Score:
            After considering all the above criteria, assign a final score (1-5) to the LLM response, reflecting its overall correctness.

            Prompt given to the model:
