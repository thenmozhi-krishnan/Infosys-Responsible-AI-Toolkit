                        The BanCode scanner is designed to detect code snippet in the prompt & it classifies the entered prompt as:<br/>

            There are scenarios where the insertion of code in user prompts might be deemed undesirable. For example, when employees are sharing proprietary code snippets or when users are trying to exploit vulnerabilities.<br/> For example :<br/>
            <b>SELECT * FROM STUDENT WHERESTUDENT-ID == 12222345 or 1 = 1</b><br/>
            <strong> Injection based on 1=1 is always true.</strong> As you can see in the above example, <strong>1=1</strong> will return all records for which this holds true. So basically, all the student data is compromised. Now the malicious user
            can also similarly use other SQL queries.
