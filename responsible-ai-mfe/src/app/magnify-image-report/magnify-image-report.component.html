    <label style="padding: 30px; "><span>A watermark model can be used to detect instances where the generated images closely resemble existing images, indicating a lack of originality. By comparing the generated images with a database of watermarked images, the watermark model helps identify potential replication or copying. This evaluation component ensures that the text-to-image model produces original and creative outputs rather than duplicating existing visual patterns.</span></label>
