## Introduction

It is the supporting module which is used for configuring the main module.
User can create recognizer, custom templates, configure Thresholds and map it to created account and portfolio.
 
## Requirements
1. Python 3.9 - 3.11
2. VSCode
3. Mongo DB
 
## Installation

To run the application, first we need to install Python and the necessary packages:
 
1. Install Python (version >= 3.9) from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure it is added to your system PATH.
 
2. Install MongoDB by following the instructions on the [official MongoDB website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).
 
3. Install `pip` if it is not already installed. You can download and install it by following the instructions on the [official pip website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

4. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

5. Navigate to the `responsible-ai-admin` directory:
    ```sh
    cd responsible-ai-admin
    ```

6. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

7. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        .\myenv\Scripts\activate
         ```
 
    - On Linux/Mac:
        ```sh

8. Now go back to `responsible-ai-admin\responsible-ai-admin` to install the requirements by running the following command : 
   ```sh
     cd responsible-ai-admin
     pip install -r .\requirement\requirement.txt
     ```

## Set Configuration Variables
After installing all the required packages, configure the variables necessary to run the APIs.

1. Navigate to the `rai_admin` directory:
    ```sh
    cd src/rai_admin
    ```
2. Locate the `.env` file, which contains keys like the following:
   ```sh
      AZUREADDFILE="${azureaddfileurl}"   # [Optional]
      CONTAINERNAME="${containername}"    # [Optional]
      DB_NAME="${dbname}"                 # [Mandatory] - Any Name : RAI_Admin_DB
      DB_USERNAME="${username}"           # [Optional] 
      DB_PWD="${password}"                # [Optional] 
      DB_IP="${ipaddress}"                # [Optional] 
      DB_PORT="${port}"                   # [Optional] 
      MONGO_PATH="mongodb://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PWD}@${DB_IP}:${DB_PORT}/"     # [Mandatory] MONGO_PATH = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"  - if using DB_TYPE = "mongo" locally. Also, use the port according your local
      DB_TYPE ="${dbtype}"                # [Mandatory] DB_TYPE = "mongo"
      RAG_IP="${rag_ip}"                  # [Optional]
      COSMOS_PATH ="${cosmos_path}"       # [Optional] - Needed if DB_TYPE = "cosmos"
   ```
   ```sh
    allow_origin = "${allow_origin}"     # allow_origin ="*"         
    To allow access to all sites, use the value *. Alternatively, you can specify a list of sites that should have access.

    allow_method = "${allow_method}"     # allow_method="GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD, DELETE, PATCH, UPDATE"
   ```
3. Replace the placeholders with your actual values.
## Running the Application

Once we have completed all the aforementioned steps, we can start the service.

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:
    ```sh
    cd ..
    ```

2. Run `main.py` file:
    ```sh
    python main.py
     ```
3. Open the following URL in your browser:
    [http://localhost:30016/api/v1/rai/admin/docs#/](http://localhost:30016/api/v1/rai/admin/docs#/)
