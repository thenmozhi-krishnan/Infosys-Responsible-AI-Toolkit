## Introduction

**LLM Explain** provides explanations for Large Language Models using methods such as token importance, Graph of Thoughts, and Search Augmentation. It evaluates the responses with metrics including uncertainty, relevancy, and coherence to ensure the reliability and clarity of Generative AI models' outputs..

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**
    
    Sentiment analysis analyzes the sentiment of a given prompt, classifies the sentiment, and identifies the key keywords that significantly influenced the model's sentiment assignment. Additionally, it provides a detailed explanation of the decision-making process behind the sentiment classification.
- **Token Importance**

    Token importance in large language models identifies which words or parts of words in a prompt are crucial for shaping the model's response. It helps us understand which tokens significantly influence the output, providing insights into how the model interprets and generates its responses.

- **Graph of Thoughts**

    The Graph of Thoughts reasoning process in large language models is a way to visualize how the model thinks. Imagine the model's ideas as dots, and the connections between them as lines. This method creates a map of these dots and lines to show how the model connects different pieces of information to come up with its answers. It helps us understand the model's logical flow and ensures that its reasoning makes sense, like how a human would think through a problem step-by-step.

- **Search Augmentation**

    Search augmentation in large language models involves using internet searches to validate and enhance the model's responses. This process supplements the model's answers with additional information from online sources, improving accuracy and reliability by cross-checking and complementing the original output.

- **Explanation Metrics**

    LLM Explanation metrics involves assessing how well a large language model's response addresses a query. It focuses on evaluating the quality of the model's answers to ensure they are clear, accurate, and relevant. This process helps in understanding and validating the usefulness of the model's responses.

    - **Uncertainty**: Measures the model’s confidence in its responses, highlighting areas where the model may exhibit lower certainty.

    - **Coherence**: Assesses the logical consistency and organization of the explanation, ensuring a clear and structured line of reasoning.

## Installation
To run the application, first we need to install Python and the necessary packages:

1. Install Python (version >= 3.9 and <= 3.12) from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure it is added to your system PATH.

2. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
         ```

5. Install `pip` if it's not already installed:
    ```sh
    python -m ensurepip --upgrade
    ```

6. Navigate to the `responsible-ai-llm-explain` directory:
    ```sh
    cd responsible-ai-llm-explain
    ```
    
7. Go to the `requirements` directory where the `requirement.txt` file is present and install the requirements:
    ```sh
    cd responsible-ai-llm-explain\requirements
    pip install -r requirement.txt
    ```
## Set Configuration Variables

After installing all the required packages, configure the variables necessary to run the APIs.

1. Navigate to the `llm_explain` directory:
    ```sh
    cd ..
    cd src/llm_explain
    ```

2. Locate the `.env` file in the project directory. This file contains several configuration keys. Make sure to fill in the mandatory fields:

    ```sh
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY = "${apikey}"          # [Mandatory]
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION = "${apiversion}"  # [Mandatory]
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = "${azureendpoint}"  # [Mandatory]
    AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_ENGINE = "${engine}"       # [Mandatory]
    SERPER_KEY = "${serperkey}"                 # [Mandatory]
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS = "${allowedorigins}"       # [Mandatory]
    ERROR_LOG_TELEMETRY_URL = "${errorlogtelemetryurl}" # [Optional]
    TELEMETRY_FLAG = "${telemetryflag}"         # [Optional]
    ```
    ```sh
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS = "${allowed_origins}"     # ALLOWED_ORIGINS ="*"         
    To allow access to all sites, use the value *. Alternatively, you can specify a list of sites that should have access.
    ```
    ```sh
    SERPER_KEY = "${serperkey}"            
    Steps to get serper key:
    1. Signup to "https://serper.dev/" with required details.
    2. Signin into account. go to the "API Keys" section in your account dashboard.
    3. Click on generate button to create new API key.
    3. Copy and assign it to SERPER_KEY variable in configuration.
    ```
    

3. Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

## Running the Application

Once we have completed all the aforementioned steps, we can start the service.

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:
    ```sh
    cd ..
    ```

2. Run `main.py` file:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

3. Open the following URL in your browser:
