** Endpoints for explainability are located in both the explainability and moderation layer repositories. Refer to the README files in these repositories for more details on specific features.

Please refer [Features and Endpoints](https://github.com/Infosys/Infosys-Responsible-AI-Toolkit/blob/Release-2.1.0/Features%20and%20Endpoints.pdf) document for more details on endpoints and their usage. 


### Modules for the Responsible AI Toolkit Interface
The Responsible AI toolkit provides a user-friendly interface for seamless experimentation and alignment with various Responsible AI principles. The following APIs are required to activate and utilize the toolkit's UI. To access the toolkit through the interface, refer to the README files associated with the listed repositories.
| # | Module | Functionalities | Repository name(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| 1 | MFE |  An Angular micro frontend app serves as a user interface where users can easily interact with and consume various backend endpoints through independently developed, modular components. | [responsible-ai-mfe](https://github.com/Infosys/Infosys-Responsible-AI-Toolkit/tree/Release-2.1.0/responsible-ai-mfe) |
| 2 | SHELL |  A shell application in a micro frontend architecture acts as the central hub, orchestrating and loading independent frontend modules. It provides a unified user interface where users can interact with different micro frontends, consume backend endpoints.| [responsible-ai-shell](https://github.com/Infosys/Infosys-Responsible-AI-Toolkit/tree/Release-2.1.0/responsible-ai-shell) |
| 3 | Backend |  A Python backend module focused on registration and authentication handles user account management, including user registration, login, password validation, and session management.| [responsible-ai-backend](https://github.com/Infosys/Infosys-Responsible-AI-Toolkit/tree/Release-2.1.0/responsible-ai-backend) |
| 4 | Telemetry | A python backend module defining the various tenets structure for ingestion of the API's data into Elasticsearch indexes. It provided customizable input validation and insertion of data coming from tenets into elasticsearch, which can be further displayed using kibana.| [responsible-ai-telemetry](https://github.com/Infosys/Infosys-Responsible-AI-Toolkit/tree/Release-2.1.0/responsible-ai-telemetry) |
| 5 | File Storage | Python module that provides versatile APIs for seamless integration across multiple microservices, enabling efficient file management with Azure Blob Storage. It supports key operations such as file upload, retrieval, and updates, offering a robust solution for handling files in Azure Blob Storage.| [responsible-ai-file-storage](https://github.com/Infosys/Infosys-Responsible-AI-Toolkit/tree/Release-2.1.0/responsible-ai-file-storage) |
| 6 | Benchmarking | Displays stats related to benchmarking large language models (LLMs) across various categories such as fairness, privacy, truthfulness and ethics. It helps evaluate and compare LLM performance in these critical areas.| [responsible-ai-llm-benchmarking](https://github.com/Infosys/Infosys-Responsible-AI-Toolkit/tree/Release-2.1.0/responsible-ai-llm-benchmarking)|
