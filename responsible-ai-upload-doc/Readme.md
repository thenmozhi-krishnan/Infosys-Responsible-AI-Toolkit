2. **Installation of Python** : Install Python (version 3.11.x) from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure it is added to your system PATH.


3. **Installation of pip** :

**Linux:**
1. Check if pip is already installed: Open a terminal and run the following command:
```sh
pip --version
```
2. If pip is not installed, you'll see an error message.
3. Install pip using get-pip.py: Download the `get-pip.py` script as follows
```sh
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```
4. Make the script executable:
```sh
chmod +x get-pip.py
```
5. Run the script:
```sh
./get-pip.py
```
6. This will install pip and its dependencies.

**Windows:**
1. Download the Python installer: Visit the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest Python installer for Windows.

2. Install Python: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" option during the installation.

3. Verify pip installation: Open a command prompt and run the following command:
```sh
pip --version
```
If pip is installed, you'll see its version.


**macOS:**

**Approach 1**
1. Check if pip is already installed: Open a Terminal window.Type
```sh 
pip --version
```
and press Enter. If pip is installed, you'll see its version.

2. Install pip using Homebrew (recommended): If pip isn't installed or you're unsure, install `Homebrew`, a popular package manager for macOS:
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" Â  
```
3. Once Homebrew is installed, use it to install pip:
```sh
brew install python
```
4. Verify the installation: Type 
```sh
pip --version
```
again.You should see the installed version of pip.

**Approach 2**

If you encounter issues or prefer a manual installation:

1. Download the get-pip.py script : Use curl to download the script:
```sh
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```
2. Run the script : Make sure you're using the correct Python interpreter (usually python3):
```sh
python3 get-pip.py
```
3. Enter your password (if prompted) : When you run the script, you might be prompted for your administrator password. This is because the installation process requires elevated privileges. Type your password and press Enter (the characters won't be displayed for security reasons).

4. Verify the installation : Once the script finishes running, you can verify that pip is installed by typing:
```sh
pip --version
```
If pip is installed correctly, you should see the installed version number displayed.


Note : If you are using mongodb as storage option then you have to use mongo as DB_TYPE.

## Installation

### Steps for Installation :

**Step 1**  : Clone the repository `responsible-ai-upload-doc`:
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```

**Step 2**  : Navigate to the `responsible-ai-upload-doc` directory:
```sh
cd responsible-ai-upload-doc
```

**Step 3**  : Activate the virtual environment for different OS.

**Windows:**
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell: Find and open the appropriate command-line interface
2. Create a virtual environment using the following python command :
```sh
> python -m venv <Name of your Virtual Environment>
```
Let's say your virtual env. name is `myenv` and is located in `C:\Users\your_username`

3. Navigate to the virtual environment directory and activate it using below command :
```sh
> cd C:\Users\your_username\myenv\Scripts
> .\activate
```
4. You should see a prompt that indicates the activated environment, such as (myenv) before your usual prompt like this :
```sh
(myenv) C:\Users\your_username\myenv\Scripts>
```
**Linux:**
1. Open a terminal: Find and open a terminal window.
2. To create a virtual environment, install the relevant version of the `venv` module.Since we are using Python 3.11, install the 3.11 variant of the package, which is named python3.11-venv
```sh
abc@demo:~/$ sudo apt install python3.11-venv
```
3. Create a Virtual env like this.
```sh
abc@demo:~/Projects/MyCoolApp$ python3.11 -m venv <Name of your Virtual Environment>
```
Let's say your virtual env. name is `myenv`

4. Activate the environment: Run the following command
```sh
abc@demo:~/Projects/MyCoolApp$ source myenv/bin/activate
```
5. You should see a prompt that indicates the activated environment, such as (myenv) before your usual prompt like this :
```sh
(myenv) abc@demo:~/Projects/MyCoolApp$
```

**MacOS:**
1. Open Terminal: Find and open the Terminal.
2. Activate the environment: Run the following commands
```sh
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv <Name of your Virtual environment>
```
Let's say, your virtual env name is `myenv`.
```sh 
source ./myenv/bin/activate 
```


**Step 4** : Go to the `requirement` directory where the `requirements.txt` file is present :

Install the requirements as shown below :
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set Configuration Variables
After installing all the required packages, configure the variables necessary to run the APIs.

1. Navigate to the `responsible-ai-upload-doc/src
/docProcess/` directory:
    ```sh
    cd src/docProcess
    ```
2. Locate the `.env` file, which contains keys like the following:
   ```sh
      DB_NAME="${dbname}"                 # [Mandatory] - Any Name : RAI_Admin_DB
      DB_TYPE ="${dbtype}"                # [Mandatory] DB_TYPE = "mongo", "cosmos"
      
      DB_USERNAME="${username}"           # [Optional] 
      DB_PWD="${password}"                # [Optional] 
      DB_IP="${ipaddress}"                # [Optional] 
      DB_PORT="${port}"                   # [Optional] 

      MONGO_PATH="mongodb://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PWD}@${DB_IP}:${DB_PORT}/"     # [Mandatory] MONGO_PATH = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"  - if using DB_TYPE = "mongo" locally. Also, use the port according your local
     
      COSMOS_PATH ="${cosmos_path}"       # [Optional] - Needed if DB_TYPE = "cosmos"

      STORAGE_OPTION="${storage_option}"  # [Mandatory] - "azure", "gcp", "aws", "mongodb"

   # If STORAGE_OPTION is "azure"
   AZURE_STORE_ADD_API="${azure_store_add_api}" # [Optional] -to store processed video 
   AZURE_STORE_GET_API="${azure_store_get_api}" # [Optional] - to get stored video 

   # If STORAGE_OPTION is "gcp"
   GCP_STORE_ADD_API="${gcp_store_add_api}"  # [Optional] -to store processed video 
   GCP_STORE_GET_API="${gcp_store_get_api}"  # [Optional] - to get stored video 

   #If STORAGE_OPTION is "aws"
   AWS_STORE_ADD_API="${aws_store_add_api}"  # [Optional] -to store processed video
   AWS_STORE_GET_API="${aws_store_get_api}"  # [Optional] - to get stored video
   AWS_BUCKET_NAME="${aws_bucket_name}"  # [Optional]

   #If STORAGE_OPTION is "mongodb" # NOTE :- IF STORAGE_OPTION is mongodb than DB_TYPE should be "mongo"
   BASE_URL="${base_url}"  #[Optional] - http://localhost:<PORT_NO>/rai/v1/docProcess

   PRIVACY_IP="${privacyapi}"
   PRIVACY_PIIVIDEO_IP="${privacy_PII_video_api}" #TO run PII Masking on Video use endpoint form privacy_files 

   SAFETY_NSFW_IP="${nsfw_ip}"  # use safety_video endpoint from safety module
   SAFETY_NUDITY_IP="${nudity_ip}" #use nudity_masking endpoint from safety module
   ```
   ```sh
    allow_origin = "${allow_origin}"     # allow_origin ="*"         
    To allow access to all sites, use the value *. Alternatively, you can specify a list of sites that should have access.

    allow_method = "${allow_method}"     # allow_method="GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD, DELETE, PATCH, UPDATE"
   ```
   NOTE : To store the videos, endpoint is needed from azure blob storage module. 

3. Replace the placeholders with your actual values.
 
## Running the Application

Once we have completed all the aforementioned steps, we can start the service.

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:
    ```sh
    cd ..
    ```

2. Run `main.py` file:
    ```sh
    python main.py
     ```
3. Use the Port No that is mentioned in main.py file. Open the swagger URL in browser once server is running:
    `http://localhost:30030/rai/v1/docProcess/docs#/`

    User can also change the port which is mentioned in main.py file

> **NOTE:** The route `/rai/v1/docProcess/download/{file_id}` only works if `STORAGE_OPTION` is set to `mongodb`. 
> This route is specifically designed to download files directly from the MongoDB database.
