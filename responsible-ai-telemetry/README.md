# Responsible AI Telemetry

## Introduction
The telemetry repository is used for getting the telemetry data from various other API's to push to elastic and visualize in the kibana.

## Features

### PII Masking Middleware
The application includes a PII (Personally Identifiable Information) masking middleware that automatically anonymizes sensitive data in telemetry logs. This middleware uses Microsoft Presidio and spaCy models to detect and mask PII entities such as:
- Names
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Social security numbers
- Other sensitive information

**How it works:**
- PII masking is **enabled by default** for all telemetry requests
- When `anonymize=true` is passed in the payload, PII masking is applied (default behavior)
- When `anonymize=false` is explicitly passed in the payload, PII masking is disabled
- If no `anonymize` parameter is provided, the system defaults to `anonymize=true`

The middleware is implemented in `middleware/text_anonymize.py` and uses the following models:
- **Presidio Analyzer** (v2.2.355): For PII entity detection
- **Presidio Anonymizer** (v2.2.355): For PII entity anonymization
- **spaCy** (v3.8.7): NLP processing engine
- **en_core_web_lg** (v3.8.0): English language model for spaCy
- **Transformers** (v4.54.1): For advanced NLP capabilities
- **Privacy library** (v2.4.0): Custom privacy detection library

### Security Headers
The application implements comprehensive security headers middleware to protect against common web vulnerabilities:
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Protects against clickjacking by blocking iframe embedding
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser's built-in XSS protection
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information to protect user privacy
- **Permissions-Policy**: Disables unnecessary browser features (geolocation, microphone, camera)
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections (production only)

These headers are automatically applied to all API responses via middleware in `main.py`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9 - 3.11
- VSCode

## Environment Variables
Locate the `.env` file, which contains keys like the following:

```sh
## TO RUN IN LOCAL SYSTEM UNCOMEENT BELOW LINES
# CHUNK_SIZE=1
# DELAY=120
# ERROR_ENVIRONMENT="local"
# ELASTIC_URL="http://<elastic_ip>:<port>/"
# ELASTIC_TIMEOUT=10
```

Replace the elastic URL with your elasticsearch IP address and uncomment all the above lines.

## Steps to run this module
1. Clone this repository in vscode

2. Create a virtual environment for python using cmd:
   ```sh
   python -m venv <env-name>
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     .\myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Linux/Mac:
     ```sh
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install all the dependencies from requirements.txt:
   ```sh
   pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt
   ```

5. Download and setup required models for PII masking:
   
   **Download the spaCy English Language Model:**
   
   The `privacy-2.4.0-py3-none-any.whl` file is already included in the `lib` folder of this repository.
   
   Download and install the **spaCy English Language Model** (v3.8.0) using:
   ```sh
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
   ```
   
   Alternatively, download directly from: [en_core_web_lg-3.8.0-py3-none-any.whl](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_lg-3.8.0/en_core_web_lg-3.8.0-py3-none-any.whl)
   
   These models are required for the PII masking middleware to function properly. The privacy library provides custom PII detection capabilities, while the spaCy model enables natural language processing for entity recognition.

6. Open `.env` file in vscode and configure the entries in it

7. In the virtual environment go to src folder of cloned repository and run:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

8. Access the API documentation at:
   ```
   http://localhost:<portno.>/rai/v1/telemetry/docs
   ```
   Use the Port No that is configured in `.env` file.

## Steps for running Elasticsearch and Kibana locally

1. Download Elasticsearch, e.g., [Elasticsearch 8.11.1](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-8-11-1)

2. Download Kibana compatible with your Elasticsearch version, e.g., [Kibana 8.11.3](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/kibana-8-11-3)

3. Ensure you have Java JDK installed, if not download a [compatible version](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

4. Extract the Elasticsearch and Kibana zip files to separate folders

5. Configure Elasticsearch:
   - Navigate to `elasticsearch folder --> Config --> elasticsearch.yml`
   - Edit the file and uncomment these values:
     ```yaml
     cluster.name:
     node.name: node-1
     network.host: 127.0.0.1
     discovery.seed_hosts: "127.0.0.1"
     cluster.initial_master_nodes: "node-1"
     http.port: 9200
     ```
   - Add these values at the end of file:
     ```yaml
     xpack.security.enabled: false
     xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: false
     xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: false
     http.cors.enabled: true
     http.cors.allow-origin: '*'
     ```

6. Start Elasticsearch:
   - Go to the `bin` folder in the Elasticsearch directory
   - Open cmd and run `elasticsearch.bat`
   - When loaded, verify by opening `http://localhost:9200` in browser

7. Start Kibana:
   - Go to the Kibana `bin` folder
   - Open cmd and run `kibana.bat`
   - Kibana will be available at `http://localhost:5601` after a few minutes

8. Update your `.env` file to use `http://localhost:9200` as the Elasticsearch URL

## Creating Dashboards in Kibana

### Accessing the Data
1. Data from services like Privacy are exported to Elasticsearch with specific indices
   - For example, privacy service data is stored in index: `privacyindexv2`

### Creating Data Views in Kibana
1. Login to Kibana at `http://localhost:5601/`
2. Navigate to Stack Management → Data Views
3. Click "Create data view"
4. For privacy data, use:
   - Index pattern: `privacyindexv2`
   - Time field: `date`
5. Click "Save data view"

### Creating Visualizations
1. Navigate to Visualizations → Create visualization
2. Select a visualization type (bar chart, line chart, pie chart, etc.)
3. Choose your data view (e.g., `privacyindexv2`)
4. Configure metrics and buckets:
   - For privacy data, useful metrics include:
     - Count of records by `response.type`
     - Distribution by `tenant`
     - Timeline of requests by `date`
5. Save your visualization with a descriptive name

### Building Dashboards
1. Navigate to Dashboard → Create dashboard
2. Click "Add" to include your saved visualizations
3. Arrange visualizations on the dashboard grid
4. Add filters at the dashboard level (e.g., filter by tenant)
5. Save your dashboard with a descriptive name

### Example: Privacy Data Dashboard
The privacy service exports data with the following structure:
- Index: `privacyindexv2`
- Key fields: `tenant`, `apiname`, `user`, `date`, `request`, `response`

To create an effective privacy monitoring dashboard:

1. Create these visualizations:
   - **Privacy Detection Types**: Pie chart showing counts by `response.type`
   - **Privacy Requests Timeline**: Line chart showing requests over time
   - **Detection Details**: Data table with columns for `date`, `apiname`, `user`, `response.type`, and `response.score`
   - **Detection Count by API**: Bar chart showing count by `apiname`

2. Combine these visualizations into a dashboard called "Privacy Monitoring Dashboard"

3. Access the dashboard at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5601/app/dashboards
   ```
   Then search for "Privacy Monitoring Dashboard"

4. Apply filters to focus on specific tenants, date ranges, or high-confidence detections
