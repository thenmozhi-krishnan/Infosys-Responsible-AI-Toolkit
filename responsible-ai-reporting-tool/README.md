## Set Configuration Variables

After installing all the required packages, configure the variables necessary to run the APIs.

1. Navigate to `src` directory:
    ```sh
    cd wrapper\src
    ```

2. Locate the `.env` file in the project directory. This file contains several configuration keys. Make sure to fill in the mandatory fields as shown below (sample values are provided for reference):

    ```sh
    DB_NAME = "${dbname}"                     # [Mandatory] DB_NAME = "raibackend"
    DB_USERNAME = "${username}"               # [Optional]
    DB_PWD = "${password}"                    # [Optional]
    DB_IP = "${ipaddress}"                    # [Optional]
    DB_PORT = "${port}"                       # [Optional]
    DB_TYPE ="${dbtype}"                      # [Mandatory] DB_TYPE = "mongo"
    MONGO_PATH = "mongodb://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PWD}@${DB_IP}:${DB_PORT}/"    # [Mandatory] MONGO_PATH = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
    COSMOS_PATH = "${cosmos_path}"            # [Optional]
    PDF_CONTAINER_NAME = "${pdf_container_name}"   # [Optional] PDF_CONTAINER_NAME = "rai-pdf-reports"
    HTML_CONTAINER_NAME = "${html_container_name}" # [Optional] HTML_CONTAINER_NAME = "rai-html-reports"
    ZIP_CONTAINER_NAME = "${html_container_name}" # [Optional] ZIP_CONTAINER_NAME = "rai-zip-files"
    ```
    ```sh
    allow_origin = "${allow_origin}"     # ALLOW_ORIGINS ="*"       
    To allow access to all sites, use the value *. Alternatively, you can specify a list of sites that should have access.
    ```
