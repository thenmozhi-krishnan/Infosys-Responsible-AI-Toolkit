This can lead to discrimination against those who may be equally creditworthy.\nSearch Engine Bias: Search engine algorithms can prioritize certain results based on factors like user location or past search history. This can create a \"filter bubble\" where users are only exposed to information that confirms their existing beliefs.\nSocial Bias:\n\nGender Bias in Job Ads: Job descriptions might contain subtle language that favors one gender over another. For example, using words like \"assertive\" for a leadership role might be seen as more applicable to men.\nRacial Bias in Facial Recognition: Facial recognition software can have higher error rates for people of color, leading to unfair surveillance or policing practices.\nConfirmation Bias:\n\nSocial Media Bias: Social media algorithms can personalize feeds to show content users are likely to engage with, reinforcing their existing beliefs and limiting exposure to opposing viewpoints.\nNews Bias: News outlets might slant their reporting to cater to a specific audience, leading to a biased understanding of current events.\nThese are just a few examples, and bias can manifest in many ways. Here are some additional categories of bias to consider:\n\nConfirmation Bias: Tendency to seek out information that confirms existing beliefs and disregard contradictory evidence.\nAvailability Bias: Overestimating the importance of recent or easily recalled events.\nAnchoring Bias: Relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making a decision.\nAttribution Bias: Assigning different motivations to people based on their group affiliation.\n\n\nAnalyze the provided context and input text.\nIdentify potential biases in the input text, considering the context.\nAlso identify the bias type(s) and the group(s) in the input text towards which there is a bias.",
