## Introduction
The backend repository is used for managing Log in, Register and Authentication of the users.

## Installation
To run the application, first we need to install Python and the necessary packages:

1. Install Python (version >= 3.9) from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure it is added to your system PATH.

2. Install MongoDB by following the instructions on the [official MongoDB website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

3. Install `pip` if it is not already installed. You can download and install it by following the instructions on the [official pip website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).


4. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

5. Navigate to the `responsible-ai-backend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd responsible-ai-backend
    ```

6. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

7. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
         ```

    - On Linux/Mac:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

8. Go to the `requirement` directory where the `requirements.txt` file is present and install the requirements:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Set Configuration Variables

After installing all the required packages, configure the variables necessary to run the APIs.

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd ..
    cd src/rai_backend
    ```

2. Locate the `.env` file in the project directory. This file contains several configuration keys. Make sure to fill in the mandatory fields as shown below (sample values are provided for reference):

    ```sh
    DB_NAME = "${dbname}"                     # [Mandatory] DB_NAME = "raibackend"
    DB_USERNAME = "${username}"               # [Optional]
    DB_PWD = "${password}"                    # [Optional]
    DB_IP = "${ipaddress}"                    # [Optional]
    DB_PORT = "${port}"                       # [Optional]
    DB_TYPE ="${dbtype}"                      # [Mandatory] DB_TYPE = "mongo"
    MONGO_PATH = "mongodb://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PWD}@${DB_IP}:${DB_PORT}/"    # [Mandatory] MONGO_PATH = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
    COSMOS_PATH = "${cosmos_path}"            # [Optional]
    SECRET_KEY = "${your_secret_key}"         # [Optional] SECRET_KEY= "your_secret_key"
    ALGORITHM = "${your_algorithm}"           # [Optional] ALGORITHM = "HS256"
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = "${minutes}" # [Optional] 30 minutes
    TOKEN_URL = "${your_token_url}"            # [Optional] TOKEN_URL =  "/token"
    AUTHENTICATE_TELEMETRY_URL = "${authenticateTelemetryUrl}"            # [Optional]
    TELEMETRY_FLAG = "${telemetryFlag}"                                    # [Optional] False if do not want to connect with telemetry 

    ```
    ```sh
    allow_origin= "${allow_origin}"     # ALLOW_ORIGINS ="*" 
    allow_methods = "${allow_methods}"   # ALLOW_METHODS ="*"        
    To allow access to all sites, use the value *. Alternatively, you can specify a list of sites that should have access.
    ```


3. Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

## Running the Application

Once we have completed all the aforementioned steps, we can start the service.

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:
    ```sh
    cd ..
    ```

2. Run `main.py` file:
    ```sh
    python main.py
     ```

3. Open the following URL in your browser: `http://localhost:<port_no>/v1/rai/backend/docs`

    User can also change the port which mentioned in main.py file

Note: v1/rai/backend/account endpoint is used by frontend module for verifying the authentication token. So the same api will be getting called when we sign in from the frontend application (Responsibile-ai-shell). While accessing the endpoint from swagger API, we will get Unauthorized 401 error because its getting called from the froned application (Responsibile-ai-shell).

## Issue Update
Resolving Cosmos DB Error:
"The index path corresponding to the specified order-by item is excluded."

If you encounter this error while hitting the Register API during backend operations, it typically means the required field (e.g., id) is not included in the indexing policy for ordering results.
To resolve this in Azure Cosmos DB:
1. Navigate to the Azure Portal and open your Cosmos DB account.

2. Go to Data Explorer.

3. In the Data Explorer, locate your User Table (Collection).

4. Click on the User Table, then go to "User Settings".

5.  Open the Indexing Policy tab.

6. Under Included Paths:

    Add a new definition:

        Type: Single Field

        Path: /id/?

        Make sure it's included and not excluded.

7. Click Save to apply the changes.

After that:
Try hitting the Register API again â€” the error should now be resolved.
