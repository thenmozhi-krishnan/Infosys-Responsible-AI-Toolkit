## Introduction
The backend repository is used for managing Log in, Register and Authentication of the users.

## Installation
To run the application, first we need to install Python and the necessary packages:

1. Install Python (version >= 3.9) from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure it is added to your system PATH.

2. Install MongoDB by following the instructions on the [official MongoDB website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

3. Install `pip` if it is not already installed. You can download and install it by following the instructions on the [official pip website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).


4. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

5. Navigate to the `responsible-ai-backend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd responsible-ai-backend
    ```

6. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

7. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
         ```

    - On Linux/Mac:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

8. Go to the `requirement` directory where the `requirements.txt` file is present and install the requirements:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Set Configuration Variables

After installing all the required packages, configure the variables necessary to run the APIs.

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd ..
    cd src/rai_backend
    ```

2. Locate the `.env` file in the project directory. This file contains several configuration keys. Make sure to fill in the mandatory fields as shown below (sample values are provided for reference):

    ```sh
    DB_NAME = "${dbname}"                     # [Mandatory] DB_NAME = "raibackend"
    DB_USERNAME = "${username}"               # [Optional]
    DB_PWD = "${password}"                    # [Optional]
    DB_IP = "${ipaddress}"                    # [Optional]
    DB_PORT = "${port}"                       # [Optional]
    DB_TYPE ="${dbtype}"                      # [Mandatory] DB_TYPE = "mongo"
    MONGO_PATH = "mongodb://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PWD}@${DB_IP}:${DB_PORT}/"    # [Mandatory] MONGO_PATH = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
    COSMOS_PATH = "${cosmos_path}"            # [Optional]
    SECRET_KEY = "${your_secret_key}"         # [Mandatory] SECRET_KEY= "your_secret_key" eg : you can give some random value like rai123
    ALGORITHM = "${your_algorithm}"           # [Mandatory] ALGORITHM = "HS256"
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = "${minutes}" # [Mandatory] ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30 
    TOKEN_URL = "${your_token_url}"            # [Mandatory] TOKEN_URL =  "/token"
    AUTHENTICATE_TELEMETRY_URL = "${authenticateTelemetryUrl}"            # [Optional]
    TELEMETRY_FLAG = "${telemetryFlag}"                                    # [Optional] False if do not want to connect with telemetry 

    ```
    ```sh
    allow_origin= "${allow_origin}"     # ALLOW_ORIGINS ="*" 
    allow_methods = "${allow_methods}"   # ALLOW_METHODS ="*"        
    To allow access to all sites, use the value *. Alternatively, you can specify a list of sites that should have access.
    ```


3. Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

## Running the Application

Once we have completed all the aforementioned steps, we can start the service.

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:
    ```sh
    cd ..
    ```

2. Run `main.py` file:
    ```sh
    python main.py
     ```

3. Open the following URL in your browser:
    [http://localhost:30019/v1/rai/backend/docs](http://localhost:30019/v1/rai/backend/docs)

    User can also change the port which mentioned in main.py file
