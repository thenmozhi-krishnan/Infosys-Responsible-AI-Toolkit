F_Desc ="Fairness and Bias refers to ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI) systems are designed and implemented in a fair and unbiased manner. Fairness and bias are required to ensure that AI systems do not perpetuate or amplify discrimination or prejudice. It is essential to develop and implement algorithms that provide fair outcomes for all individuals, regardless of their background or characteristics. It involves minimizing any discriminatory or biased outcomes that may arise due to biased training data or algorithmic biases. "
D_Desc ="Fairness should be addressed at every stage of the AI lifecycle, including data collection, preprocessing, algorithm development, model training, and deployment. Ensuring fairness is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, evaluation, and improvement."
Obj_Desc =  "The objective of this report is to identify fairness of the dataset by analyzing potential biases using metrics that might favor or disadvantage certain groups or individuals."
